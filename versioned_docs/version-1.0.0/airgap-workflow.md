## What's an Airgap?

An airgap is a highly secure environment that is physically isolated from external connectivity (usually the internet), ensuring complete isolation from other environments by preventing unauthorized access or data transfers.

### Example Use Cases

- **Government and Military:** Protect sensitive government and military information and critical defense infrastructure.
- **Critical Infrastructure:** Secure power grids, water supply systems, and transportation networks from cyber threats.
- **Financial Institutions:** Safeguard financial transactions and customer data from cyberattacks.
- **Research Facilities:** Protect valuable research data, intellectual property, and proprietary information.

## Challenges of an Airgap

- **Data Transfers:** Transferring data in and out of an air-gapped system is complex due to the lack of network connectivity. It often involves physical media, trusted intermediaries, and tedious approvals.
- **Usability vs. Security Balance:** Achieving a balance between security and usability can be a delicate task, as convenience is limited in such environments.
- **Maintenance Complexity:** Regular system updates, package and dependency updates, and maintenance can be challenging, as limited network connectivity complicates the process.
- **Costly Implementation:** Setting up and maintaining air-gapped systems can be expensive, requiring the use of specialized workflows and protocols.
